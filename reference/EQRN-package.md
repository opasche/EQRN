# EQRN: Extreme Quantile Regression Neural Networks for Risk Forecasting

This framework enables forecasting and extrapolating measures of
conditional risk (e.g. of extreme or unprecedented events), including
quantiles and exceedance probabilities, using extreme value statistics
and flexible neural network architectures. It allows for capturing
complex multivariate dependencies, including dependencies between
observations, such as sequential dependence (time-series). The
methodology was introduced in Pasche and Engelke (2024)
[doi:10.1214/24-AOAS1907](https://doi.org/10.1214/24-AOAS1907) (also
available in preprint: Pasche and Engelke (2022)
[doi:10.48550/arXiv.2208.07590](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2208.07590)
