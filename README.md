EQRN is a framework for forecasting and extrapolating measures of
conditional risk (e.g. of extreme or unprecedented events), including
quantiles and exceedance probabilities, using extreme value statistics
and flexible neural network architectures. It allows for capturing
complex multivariate dependencies, including dependencies between
observations, such as sequential (time) dependence. This implementation
is based on the methodology introduced in [Pasche and Engelke
(2024)](#references-and-links)

## Installation

To install the development version of EQRN, simply run from R:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("opasche/EQRN")
```

When the package is first loaded interactively after installation
(e.g. with `library(EQRN)` or with any `EQRN::fct()`), the necessary
backend software from the [`torch`](https://torch.mlverse.org/)
dependency is automatically installed. Alternatively,
`EQRN::install_backend()` can be called to perform the backend
installation manually (necessary for non-interactive environments). For
more information about the torch backend and troubleshooting, visit the
[torch installation
guide](https://torch.mlverse.org/docs/articles/installation.html).

## Motivation

Risk assessment for extreme events requires accurate estimation of high
quantiles that go beyond the range of historical observations. When the
risk depends on the values of observed predictors, regression techniques
are used to interpolate in the predictor space. In this package we
propose the EQRN model that combines tools from neural networks and
extreme value theory into a method capable of extrapolation in the
presence of complex predictor dependence. Neural networks can naturally
incorporate additional structure in the data. The recurrent version of
EQRN is able to capture complex sequential dependence in time series.

In [the corresponding article](https://doi.org/10.1214/24-AOAS1907),
EQRN is applied to forecasting of flood risk in the Swiss Aare
catchment. It exploits information from multiple covariates in space and
time to provide one-day-ahead predictions of return levels and
exceedances probabilities. This output complements the static return
level from a traditional extreme value analysis and the predictions are
able to adapt to distributional shifts as experienced in a changing
climate. Our model can help authorities to manage flooding more
effectively and to minimize their disastrous impacts through early
warning systems.

## Basic usage example for exchangeable data

The minimal example below illustrates, in three simple steps, how to use
the package functions to fit the EQRN model and predict extreme
conditional quantiles and other metrics on new test data. In this
example, a toy i.i.d. dataset is used.

### 0. Generate a toy dataset

``` r
scale_fct <- function(x1,x2){ 3 + cos(x1 + x2 + 0.5) }

set.seed(1)
X_train <- matrix(stats::runif(5120), ncol=2)
y_train <- scale_fct(X_train[,1], X_train[,2]) * stats::rt(2560, 4)

X_test <- matrix(stats::runif(2560), ncol=2)
```

### Step 1. Construct intermediate quantiles

This can be achieved with any suitable quantile regression method. We
here use generalised random forests from the
[`grf`](https://grf-labs.github.io/grf/) package, as they are very easy
to use and already quite flexible. One could for example use a quantile
regression neural network instead.

``` r
library(grf)

# Choose an intermediate probability level.
interm_lvl <- 0.8

# Fit a GRF for quantile regression with 500 trees (the more the better) on the training set (with a seed for reproducibility).
fit_grf <- grf::quantile_forest(X_train, y_train, num.trees=1000, seed=21)

# Construct out-of-bag intermediate quantiles on the training set.
intermediateq_train <- predict(fit_grf, newdata=NULL, quantiles=c(interm_lvl))$predictions
```

### Step 2. Fit the tail model

Fit the EQRN network on the training set, with the intermediate
quantiles as a varying threshold. Here:

- the argument `shape_fixed=TRUE` removes covariate dependence from the
  shape output,
- the argument `net_structure=c(5,5)` sets two hidden layers of 5
  neurons each as an architecture,
- the network is trained for 100 epochs (with a seed for
  reproducibility).

``` r
library(EQRN)

fit_eqrn <- EQRN_fit(X_train, y_train, intermediateq_train, interm_lvl,
                     shape_fixed=TRUE, net_structure=c(5,5), n_epochs=100, seed=42)
#> Epoch: 1 out of 100 , average train loss: 2.371921
#> Epoch: 100 out of 100 , average train loss: 2.281698
```

The arguments values are here arbitrarily chosen for illustration. As
for any machine learning approach, hyperparameters should be tuned using
set-aside validation data to obtain an accurate fit. Stopping criteria
are also available for the number of fitting epochs. Refer to the
[documentation](https://opasche.github.io/EQRN/reference/index.html#fitting-eqrn-tail-neural-networks)
for a detailed description of the arguments, and to the [article’s
repository](https://github.com/opasche/EQRN_Results) for more advanced
examples.

### Step 3. Predict conditional quantiles and risk metrics for new test observations

``` r
# Desired probability levels at which to predict the conditional quantiles.
levels_predict <- c(0.999, 0.9999)

# Predict intermediate test quantiles using the intermediate model.
intermediateq_test <- predict(fit_grf, newdata=X_test, quantiles=c(interm_lvl))$predictions

# Predict the desired conditional extreme quantiles on the test set.
qpred_eqrn <- EQRN_predict(fit_eqrn, X_test, levels_predict, intermediateq_test)

# Forecast the probability that Y_test would exceed a certain large value.
large_value <- 10
ppred_eqrn <- EQRN_excess_probability(large_value, fit_eqrn, X_test, intermediateq_test)
```

``` r
# Print some predictions:
hn <- 10
results <- data.frame(X1=X_test[1:hn,1], X2=X_test[1:hn,2], pred_Y_Q_80=intermediateq_test[1:hn],
                      pred_Y_Q_99.9=qpred_eqrn[1:hn,1], pred_Y_Q_99.99=qpred_eqrn[1:hn,2], Pr_Y_exceed_10=ppred_eqrn[1:hn])

print(results)
